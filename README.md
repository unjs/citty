## Install

Install package:

```sh
npm install citty
```

```sh
yarn add citty
```

```sh
pnpm install citty
```

## Usage

### Import Package

```js
// ESM
import { defineCommand, runMain } from "citty";
```

```js
// CommonJS
const { defineCommand, runMain } = require("citty");
```

### Main Command

Create a main command is the first step to create a CLI app. You can do it in a `index.mjs` file.

```js
import { defineCommand, runMain } from "citty";

const main = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "hello",
    version: "1.0.0",
    description: "My Awesome CLI App",
  },
  args: {
    name: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "Your name",
      required: true,
    },
    friendly: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Use friendly greeting",
    },
  },
  run({ args }) { // Command can be async
    console.log(`${args.friendly ? "Hi" : "Greetings"} ${args.name}!`);
  },
});

runMain(main);
```

Then, you can execute your CLI app:

```sh
node index.mjs john
# output: Greetings john!
```

### Sub Commands

You can define sub commands and attach them to main command to create a nested command structure. This is recursive so you can attach sub commands to sub commands, etc.

```js
import { defineCommand, runMain } from "citty";

// First, you define a new command
const sub = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "sub",
    description: "Sub command",
  },
  args: { // Sub commands can have their own arguments like any other command
    name: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "Your name",
      required: true,
    },
  },
  run({ args }) { // Command can be async
    console.log(`Hello ${args.name}!`);
  },
});

// Then, you define a main command and attach sub command to it
const main = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "hello",
    version: "1.0.0",
    description: "My Awesome CLI App",
  },
  commands: {
    sub, // Attach sub command to main command
  },
});

runMain(main);
```

Then, you can execute your CLI app:

```sh
node index.mjs sub john
# output: Hello john!
```

### Hooks

`citty` supports a `setup` and `cleanup`  functions that are called before and after command execution. This is useful for setting up and cleaning up resources.

Only the `setup` and `cleanup` functions from the command called are executed. For example, if you run `hello sub`, only the `setup` and `cleanup` functions from `sub` command are executed and not the ones from `hello` command.

```js
import { defineCommand, runMain } from "citty";

const main = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "hello",
    version: "1.0.0",
    description: "My Awesome CLI App",
  },
  setup() { // Setup function is called before command execution or before any sub command execution
    console.log("Setting up...");
  },
  cleanup() { // Cleanup function is called after command execution or after any sub command execution
    console.log("Cleaning up...");
  },
  run() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
  },
});

runMain(main);
```

Now, you can run your CLI app:

```sh
node index.mjs
```

And you will see:

```sh
Setting up...
Hello World!
Cleaning up...
```

### Lazy Load Commands

For large CLI apps, you may want to only load the command that is being executed.

First, create a command in a file named `sub.mjs` and export it.

```js
import { defineCommand } from "citty";

export default defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "sub",
    description: "Sub command",
  },
  args: {
    name: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "Your name",
      required: true,
    },
  },
  run({ args }) {
    console.log(`Hello ${args.name}!`);
  },
});
```

Then, create the main command and import the sub command.

```js
const main = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "hello",
    version: "1.0.0",
    description: "My Awesome CLI App",
  },
  commands: {
    sub: () => import("./sub.mjs").then((m) => m.default), // Lazy Import Sub Command
  },
});
```

Now, when you run `node index.mjs sub`, the sub command will be loaded and executed. This avoid to load all commands at once when you start your app.

### Publish CLI App as an Executable

You must first bundle your CLI app. To do so, you can use [`unjs/unbuild`](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild).

Then, you must create a file named `index.mjs` in a folder named `bin` at the root of your package. This file must export the main command from the `dist` build.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { runMain } from '../dist/index.mjs'

runMain()
```

Then, you will need to update your `package.json` file to enable the usage as a CLI:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "bin": "./bin/index.mjs",
  // Name of the CLI will be the name of the package. You can provide an object to change the name.
  // @see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#bin
  // "bin": {
  //   "my-cli": "./bin/index.mjs"
  // },
  "files": [
    "bin",
    "dist"
  ]
}
```

You're ready to publish your CLI app to npm!

## Args Commands

When you create a command with `defineCommand`, you can provide a `args` object to define the arguments of the command. For example:

```js
const main = defineCommand({
  // ...
  args: {
    name: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "Your name",
      required: true,
    },
    friendly: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Use friendly greeting",
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

There is 3 types of arguments:

- `boolean`: A boolean flag. Can be set to `true` or `false`. Can be set using a shortcut like `--flag` (if `false` is the default or `--no-flag` if `true` is the default).
- `string`: A string flag. Can be set using a value like `--flag value`.
- `positional`: A positional argument. Can be set using a value like `value`.

Then, you can add a description to each argument. This description will be used to generate the usage of the command. You can also use `required` to make an argument required or not.

You can also set a default value for each argument. For example:

```js
const main = defineCommand({
  // ...
  args: {
    name: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "Your name",
      default: "Foo",
    },
    friendly: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Use friendly greeting",
      default: true,
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

Finally, you can set aliases for each argument. For example:

```js
const main = defineCommand({
  // ...
  args: {
    name: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "Your name",
      required: true,
      alias: ["n", "N"],
    },
    friendly: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Use friendly greeting",
      alias: ["f", "F"],
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

Then, use can use these arguments in the `run` function of the command because they are passed as parameters:

```js
const main = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "sub",
    description: "Sub command",
  },
  args: {
    name: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "Your name",
      required: true,
    },
  },
  run({ args }) {
    console.log(`Hello ${args.name}!`);
  },
});
```

`args` is an object fully typed with the type of each argument. For example, if you have a `string` argument, the type of the argument will be `string`. If you have a `boolean` argument, the type of the argument will be `boolean`.
